# Python Lane Recognition
Run file line.py to demo lane recogntion using OpenCV for images and videos. Code is setup for both image and video. User selects between image and video through dialog box. Source files for image is test_image.jpg and video is test2.mp4

# Python Linear Regression
Run file Linear_Regression.py to see demo of simple one-percepton neural network using only python code

# Keros Neural Network
Run file Percepton_Keras.ipynb to see demo of simple one-percepton neural network. The fucntionality is the same as for Linear_Regression.py but it uses Keras library for enhanced performance
